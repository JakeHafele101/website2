                    My Portfolio
                </Header>

                <General>
                    Welcome anyone and everyone to my project portfolio website! I updated this website for over five years through my undergraduate and graduate programs at Iowa State University. This portfolio holds information on everything I completed while studying Electrical Engineering in undergrad and Computer Engineering in graduate school. This includes my projects, work experience, and an up-to-date resume. Alongside all of the projects I have worked on, I really enjoyed recording videos going over each project and editing them, which I think is much more accessible for someone who is interested in my work or what I do. For now, I have decided to shelf this website, but keep it up as a time capsule for my time at Iowa State. This website, and especially the videos, are a great indicator of how much I have grown in such a short time, and it really is unnerving to look back on. I am so very thankful for all of the amazing friends, professors, and students I got to work with there. Each and every one helped me reach my goals after graduating!  <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    During Summer 2024, I started a position as a Logic Design Engineer at Forward Edge ASIC, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary. Since then, I have been applying my experience in school relating to digital VLSI design to work on multiple digital systems, as was my goal since starting graduate school. As I was exiting my graduate research, I helped to setup a brand-new open-source ASIC design club at Iowa State University, which I hope to help connect with work and engage with students further. If you are a student at Iowa State or interested in general, please reach out to me!<br><br>

                <h4>Featured Projects</h4>

                <General>
                    Below is a list of some of my favorite and most interesting projects to this day! I think all of
                    these projects show how much I have grown as an engineer in school, and what I have to look forward
                    to in my future classes, projects, and career in general. If you are interested in some embedded or
                    3D printing work, I would suggest you take a look at my Freshman year projects. If you would like to
                    learn more
                    about my time on Solar Car, or how I started my journey with PCB design, then I would suggest
                    reading
                    up on my Sophomore and Junior year projects page. As of my senior year, I have been working on a lot
                    of FPGA projects both on my own and in school, so the Senior year page would be great for that. Hope
                    you enjoy! <br> <br>

                    About Me
                </Header>

                <General>
                    I grew up in central Illinois, and attended both undergraduate and graduate school at Iowa State University for Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. Throughout college, I was involved in multiple clubs, including the ISU marching band, Critical Tinkers, and PrISUm solar car. Each of these groups gave me fantastic opportunities to meet friends and work together making something great. I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where I enjoy finding new breweries, going to see movies, and spending time with my cat, Nutter Butter. I also enjoy recording and editing YouTube videos, many of which are documented on this website as different projects. 
                    <br> <br>

                    GoPro Videos
                </Header>

                <General>
                    During the Summer of 2023, I decided to buy a GoPro while I was on Co-op at Collins Aerospace. While I
                    have not gone to too many adventurous places yet, I have really enjoyed editing together videos of me
                    spending time with my friends. I think that capturing both the technical and fun parts of my college
                    career has been very rewarding, and it goes to show how much I have grown throughout my time at Iowa
                    State. If you care to see some of the videos I've made, check them out below!
